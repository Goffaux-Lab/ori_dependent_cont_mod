This repository is for orientation-dependent contextual modulation experiments,
as explained in Mannion et al. (2017) and Serrano-Pedraza et al. (2014)


The experiment uses the PsiMarginal staircase to define the contrast levels in
each trial. In order to do that, the PsiMarginal.py and Low_Hori_2afc.py should
always be in the same folder.
